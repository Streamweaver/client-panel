# Client Panel

This project is an angular app that uses multiple components to simulate a client management panel with examples of nested components and aggregate functions.  This app is created as part of Lesson 9 of the Udemy Course [Angular 4 Front to Back](https://www.udemy.com/angular-4-front-to-back) which I highly recommend.

This code is being kept around mostly for my own reference.
